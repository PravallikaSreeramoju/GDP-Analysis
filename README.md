# GDP-Analysis
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key indicator of a countryâ€™s economic health and development.
This project introduces a GDP Analysis System that leverages Machine Learning Regression Techniques to analyze historical GDP data and predict future trends. The proposed system employs supervised learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression , XGBoost ,and deep learning models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and Transformer-based architectures to accurately model GDP fluctuations. Feature engineering techniques such as economic indicators, inflation rates, trade balances, and government expenditures enhance prediction accuracy. The system is trained on large-scale economic datasets, including World Bank, IMF, and national economic reports, capturing key factors that impact GDP variations. By analyzing these economic parameters, the system supports policy decision-making, financial forecasting, and economic growth planning.
